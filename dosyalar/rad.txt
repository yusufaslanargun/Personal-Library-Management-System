Introduction
The Personal Library Management System (PLMS) is conceived as a single-user application that enables an individual to organize and maintain a private collection of books and DVDs. The project is motivated by the need to reduce manual effort and errors in cataloging, improve findability via search and facets, keep a reliable record of reading/viewing progress, and track loans with due/overdue awareness. This document presents PLMS at the analysis level: it declares what the system shall do and how it is structured conceptually using object-oriented modeling and UML, without prescribing implementation technologies or UI aesthetics. The intended audience includes course staff (for compliance with the template), analysts/designers (to turn requirements into design), and developers/testers (to derive verifiable test cases). The remainder of Section 1 clarifies the purpose, scope, success criteria, key terms, references, and how the document is organized.

Purpose of the system
This document defines the analysis-level requirements and conceptual object-oriented models of the Personal Library Management System (PLMS). It specifies what the system shall do and how it is structured conceptually, so that design and implementation can proceed with minimal ambiguity and rework.

Scope of the system
PLMS is a single-user application for managing a personal library of books and DVDs. In scope: item creation (manual and via ISBN), metadata enrichment from external providers, search/filter, user-defined lists, progress logging, basic loan tracking, import/export, and optional cloud sync. Out of scope: detailed UI aesthetics, concrete database schema, and technology stack decisions (these belong to design).

Objectives and success criteria of the project
	•	Accurate cataloging: Add via ISBN in ≤ 3 steps with correct metadata.
	•	Findability: Search over ~5,000 items responds in ≤ 1.5 s (95p).
	•	Organization: Lists with persistent ordering/priority.
	•	Progress tracking: Entry in ≤ 2 steps, immediate visual update.
	•	Reliability: No data loss under normal usage; graceful API error handling.
	•	Usability: Clear validation, empty states, and error messages.

Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations
	•	PLMS: Personal Library Management System
	•	Item/Media Item: Book or DVD record
	•	ISBN: International Standard Book Number
	•	CRUD: Create/Read/Update/Delete
	•	External Provider: Online metadata source (books/films API)
	•	FR/NFR: Functional/Nonfunctional Requirement
	•	UML: Unified Modeling Language
	•	List/List Item: User-made collection and its entries
	•	Progress Log: History of reading/viewing progress
	•	Loan: Temporary lending of an item
	•	Soft delete: Hidden but recoverable removal.

References
	•	Course assignment brief and required RAD template.
	•	Public documentation of book/film metadata services.

Overview
Section 2 summarizes the current situation. Section 3 details the proposed system: overview (3.1), Functional Requirements (3.2), Nonfunctional Requirements (3.3), and System Models (3.4: scenarios, UML, UI). Section 4 provides a glossary.

Current system
There is no dedicated application. The user relies on memory and scattered notes. Consequences: slow and error-prone item entry, poor findability, no progress history, risk of duplicate purchases, and untracked loans. A structured single-user system will reduce effort, improve accuracy, and surface reminders (e.g., due/overdue loans). 
Proposed system
A single-user web application that centralizes personal library management for books/DVDs
Overview
PLMS will provide:
	•	Inventory: Manual add/edit/delete; Add via ISBN with external metadata; tags, condition, location.
	•	Search & filter: Full-text search + facets (type/author/cast/tag/year/loan status).
	•	Lists: Create/rename/delete; add/remove items; reorder with persistent positions.
	•	Progress: Log reading/viewing progress and sessions; compute percent; visualize.
	•	Loans: Mark loaned/returned; due & overdue visibility.
	•	Data I/O & Sync: Import/export (CSV/JSON); optional cloud sync for one user across devices.
	•	Assumptions: Single owner; only metadata (no copyrighted content) is stored.
Functional requirements
Inventory & metadata
	•	FR-01 — Add via ISBN/barcode. The system shall add items via ISBN/barcode using external metadata lookup.
Acceptance: Given a valid ISBN, the system returns ≥1 candidate or a clear “no match” in ≤ 5 s; user can confirm a candidate; the item is created and searchable; an ExternalLink is stored.
	•	FR-02 — Manual create. The system shall allow manual item creation (title, type [Book/DVD], year).
Acceptance: Required fields validated; on success, item appears in inventory and search.
	•	FR-03 — Edit & soft delete/restore. The system shall support editing and soft-deleting/restoring items.
Acceptance: Soft-deleted items are hidden from default views but recoverable from Trash; restore returns full visibility.
	•	FR-04 — Tags/condition/location. The system shall maintain tags, condition, and location per item.
Acceptance: Changes persist and are visible in item detail and search facets.
	•	FR-05 — Search & multi-facet filter. The system shall provide full-text search and multi-facet filtering. Acceptance: Filters combine with AND semantics; pagination stable; relevance sort by default. 
External integration
	•	FR-06 — Provider query. The system shall query at least one external provider for metadata.
Acceptance: Queries conform to provider API; rate-limit respected; network errors surfaced to user.
	•	FR-07 — Persist mapping. The system shall persist a link (provider, externalId, url) to the matched record.
Acceptance: Item retains mapping across sessions; mapping visible in item detail.
	•	FR-08 — Update mapped fields. The system shall update mapped fields when provider data changes, with confirmation.
Acceptance: Changes previewed before apply; user can accept/skip per field.
	•	FR-09 — Errors & retry. The system shall show clear errors and allow retry or manual add on lookup failures.
Acceptance: Error banner shows reason; “Retry” available; “Switch to Manual” navigates to UC-02.
Lists & organization
	•	FR-10 — List CRUD. The system shall create, rename, and delete lists.
Acceptance: Name validation; delete requires confirmation if non-empty.
	•	FR-11 — Add/remove & reorder. The system shall add/remove items and reorder within lists.
Acceptance: No duplicate entries within the same list; new order persists.
	•	FR-12 — Persistent priority. The system shall persist per-list priority/order and show it consistently.
Acceptance: After refresh, the same order is displayed.
Progress tracking
	•	FR-13 — Reading progress (books). Record page/chapter and computed percent.
Acceptance: Percent = current/total (clamped 0–100%); invalid values rejected with message.
	•	FR-14 — Viewing progress (DVDs). Record minute/scene and computed percent.
Acceptance: Same as FR-13 but with runtime.
	•	FR-15 — Session logs. Maintain date, optional duration, and value for each progress entry.
Acceptance: New rows appear in history immediately; entries are timestamped.
	•	FR-16 — Visual indicators. Update progress indicator instantly after save.
Acceptance: UI reflects new percent without page reload.
Loans & data I/O
	•	FR-17 — Mark as loaned. Mark item as loaned with toWhom, startDate, dueDate.
Acceptance: Status Loaned; due visible on dashboard; validation ensures dueDate ≥ startDate.
	•	FR-18 — Mark as returned. Mark loan as returned (returnedAt) and set status.
Acceptance: Status becomes Available; loan history preserved.
	•	FR-19 — Import/Export. Export/import data as CSV/JSON.
Acceptance: Export contains items/lists/progress/loans; import validates schema and shows a summary.
	•	FR-20 — Cloud sync (optional). Single-user multi-device sync.
Acceptance: First run performs full sync; subsequent changes propagate; conflicts resolved by last-write-wins with notice.
Nonfunctional requirements
Usability
	•	NFR-U1 “Add via ISBN” completes in ≤ 3 steps. (Verification: usability test)
	•	NFR-U2 Progress entry completes in ≤ 2 steps with immediate feedback. (Test)
	•	NFR-U3 Clear empty states (no results, empty list) and validation messages. (Inspection)
	•	NFR-U4 Keyboard accessibility for core actions (search, add, save). (Inspection/Test)

Reliability
	•	NFR-R1 No data loss in normal operation; autosave for critical actions. (Test)
	•	NFR-R2 External API failures handled gracefully; local operations remain available. (Test)
	•	NFR-R3 One active loan per item enforced. (Analysis/Test)
	•	NFR-R4 Import validates schema; rejects malformed records. (Test)

Performance
	•	NFR-P1 Search over ≤ 5,000 items responds in ≤ 1.5 s (95p). (Measurement)
	•	NFR-P2 Item detail (with mapping) opens in ≤ 1.0 s (95p). (Measurement)
	•	NFR-P3 UI input remains responsive (≥ 55 FPS) during normal interactions. (Measurement)

Supportability
	•	NFR-Spt1 Modular components (inventory, metadata, lists, progress, loans). (Inspection)
	•	NFR-Spt2 Logging (INFO/WARN/ERROR) and minimal health diagnostics. (Inspection)
	•	NFR-Spt3 Provider endpoint & API key configurable without code change. (Inspection)

Implementation
	•	Tech-agnostic at analysis level; any stack satisfying FR/NFR is acceptable.
	•	Local storage permitted; optional cloud sync; offline queue for pending sync (if implemented).

Interface
	•	User interface: Desktop-first responsive web UI; consistent terminology; accessible controls.
	•	External interfaces: JSON/REST book/film metadata API; secure API key storage; rate-limit/error handling.

Packaging
The RAD will be delivered as a single, self-contained Word document (.docx).

Legal
